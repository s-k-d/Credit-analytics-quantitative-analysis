Loan Data Analysis  
This repository contains an analysis of loan data provided in the loans.csv.csv dataset. The project aims to derive insights from the data and present them through a detailed report and code implementation in a Jupyter notebook.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure 
The repository consists of the following files:

loans.csv.csv: The dataset used for analysis.
Assignment.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights generation.  
Report.pdf: A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and key insights from the analysis.  

## ðŸ“ŠObjective
The primary goal of this project is to perform a thorough analysis of the loan data to identify trends, patterns, and potential areas of interest. The analysis includes:

1.Data cleaning and preprocessing. 
2.Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships and trends. 
3.Visualization of key insights.

## ðŸš€Getting Started  
To run this project on your local system, follow these steps: 
Copy code 
git clone https://github.com/s-k-d/loan-data-analysis.git   
cd loan-data-analysis  
Open the Jupyter Notebook: 
bash 
Copy code 
jupyter notebook Assignment.ipynb   
Follow the code cells to understand the data analysis workflow. 
## ðŸ“ˆKey Insights 
1.Preliminary insights from the dataset indicate significant patterns in loan amounts, interest rates, and repayment terms.   
2.Detailed visualizations highlight correlations between variables such as borrower credit score and loan approval.
